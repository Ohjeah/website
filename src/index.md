Hi, I'm **Markus Quade**.

My research is focussed on symbolic regression and its application to dynamical systems for time series prediction, system identification and control. More broadly I am interested in complex systems and stochastic processes. 

As the CTO of [Ambrosys](www.ambrosys.de), I am committed to integrating a holistic agile approach into software development and machine learning. My expertise lies in crafting and implementing agile strategies, leading complex projects, and fostering innovation. I work across diverse domains, including Renewable Energy, Automotive, Tolling, Agile Transformation, Digital Asset Management, IoT Solutions, and Consulting.

If you want to get in touch just send me an [<i class="far fa-envelope" aria-hidden="true"></i>](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).
